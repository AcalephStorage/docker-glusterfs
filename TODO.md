o Currently it is using host based networking. Try to find a way avoid this and maybe connect to fellow glusterfs pods to probe.
o Check if possible not to use `privileged=true` as this will allow capabilities almost the same as with the parent node.
o Update docs
o Housekeeping
o Proper error handling and checkings
